# sudoku-solver-AI
Code for sudoku board generator and sudoku solver AI based on constraint satisfaction heuristics and checks.

The sudoku board generator creates boards of size 9 by 9 with 7 given values, 9 by 16 with 11 given values, 16 by 16 with 20 given values, and 25 by 25 with 30 given values. The level of difficulty increases as the size of the board increases and is determined by user input.

The sudoku solver AI implements forward checking, Norvig's check, minimum remaining values heuristic, degree heuristic, least constrained value heuristic, depth-first search, breadth-first search, and backtracking to accurately solve the generated sudoku boards.
